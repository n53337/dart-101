### Object Oriented Programming Pransiples

- Encapsulation :
  - We put related things together in a "box" called an object. The object has its own properties and actions. We can control how these properties and actions are accessed from outside the object. This helps keep the code organized and prevents others from accidentally changing or accessing things they shouldn't. 

- Abstraction :
  - It means hiding the complicated details and only showing the important things. We create objects and give them certain abilities or actions, but we don't need to know how they work internally. We can use these objects without worrying about their complex inner workings

- Polymorphism:
  - polymorphism means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they are the same type.

- Inheraitance
  - We have something called "classes". A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties and actions that objects of that class can have.
